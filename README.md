Anisotropic Kuwahara Filtering with Polynomial Weighting Functions

This program implements a simple benchmark for the anisotropic Kuwahara filter with texture-based weighting functions and the anisotropic Kuwahara filter with polynomial weighting functions. It was written by [Jan Eric Kyprianidis](http://www.kyprianidis.com/) while working as a research scientist for the [computer graphics systems group](http://www.hpi3d.de/) of the [Hasso-Plattner-Institut](http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/) at the University of Potsdam, Germany. For details see (Kyprianidis & et al., 2010).
